n Terraform, data sources serve as a bridge between your configuration and
 existing resources or information external to your infrastructure code. Data
 sources allow you to query external systems or services for information that
 you need to use in your Terraform configurations. They provide a way to incorporate
 existing data into your infrastructure definitions, enhancing the flexibility and
 versatility of your code.

Here are some key points about data sources in Terraform:

    Querying External Information: Data sources enable you to retrieve specific
 details or attributes from external systems, such as cloud providers' APIs, databases,
 registries, or other remote services.

    Read-Only: Unlike resources that Terraform manages, data sources are read-only. 
They provide information but don't manage the lifecycle of the external resource.

    Use Cases: Data sources are valuable in scenarios where you want to reference
 existing resources or data that aren't defined within your Terraform configuration.
 This can include retrieving information about virtual networks, existing security
 groups, DNS records, or even data from external databases.

    Syntax: Data sources are defined using a similar syntax to resources, but with
 the data keyword instead of resource. You specify the data source type and configure
 the required attributes to perform the query.

    References: You can reference the attributes retrieved by a data source in your
 configuration. These attributes can be used in resource definitions or for making
 decisions within your configuration.

    Dependency Management: Just like with resources, Terraform understands dependencies
 between data sources and the resources they affect. It ensures that data sources are 
queried before the resources that depend on their output are created or modified.

Here's a simple example of using an AWS data source to retrieve information about an
 existing Amazon S3 bucket:

data "aws_s3_bucket" "existing_bucket" {
  bucket = "my-existing-bucket"
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "example" {
  bucket = data.aws_s3_bucket.existing_bucket.id

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17",
    Statement = [
      {
        Effect = "Allow",
        Principal = "*",
        Action = "s3:GetObject",
        Resource = "${data.aws_s3_bucket.existing_bucket.arn}/*",
      },
    ],
  })
}

In this example, the data "aws_s3_bucket" block queries the attributes of an existing S3 
bucket named "my-existing-bucket." The bucket's attributes are then used in the creation
 of an S3 bucket policy resource.

Data sources in Terraform allow you to integrate external information seamlessly into your
 infrastructure code, providing a dynamic and efficient way to manage your resources while 
leveraging existing data and services.
