 Output variables in Terraform provide a way to expose information from your
 infrastructure setup to the outside world. They allow you to capture values 
from various resources and make them available for reference or further processing
 after the infrastructure is provisioned. Output variables are especially useful
 when you want to share information with other parts of your organization or when
 integrating Terraform with external tools.

Here's a simple example of how output variables are defined in a Terraform configuration:
resource "aws_instance" "my_instance" {
  ami           = "ami-12345678"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

output "instance_id" {
  value = aws_instance.my_instance.id
}

In this example, the output block defines an output variable named instance_id 
that captures the id attribute of the aws_instance resource. Once Terraform provisions
 the infrastructure, you can access this output variable to retrieve the instance ID.

Output variables can be accessed using the terraform output command or programmatically
 via the Terraform API. They are valuable for passing information between different Terraform
 configurations, sharing data with other tools, or providing meaningful insights into your provisioned infrastructure.

1. navigate to the directory called
/root/terraform-projects/data. we have used the configuration files creaated in this directory
to create some resources. inspect them.

2. which provider is used by the configuration files in this directory? 
Ans= inspect the resource blocks defined, all of them use a common provider. Ans=random

3. which two resources types are configured in the configuration files?
random-uuid and random_integer

4. we also defined a few output variables in the output.tf file in this configuration directory.
inspect them.
run the terraform workflow.

5. what is the value of the output variable called Id2 use the terraform output command.

6. what is the value of the output variable called order 1
Ans= 29502

7. we have a new configuration directory located at the path /root/terraform-projects/output.
inspect the configuration files that are created in this directory. what is the value of the 
output variable pet-name? use the terraform output command within the new configuration directory.
Ans=Antelop

8. we have just updated the main.tf file in this directory with a new resource block. add a new
output variable with the following specifications:
output variable Name: Welcome_message
Value: content of the resource called welcome
when ready, run terraform workflow.
resource and output variables created.
