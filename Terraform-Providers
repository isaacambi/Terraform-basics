Terraform providers are plugins that enable Terraform, an infrastructure 
as code tool, to interact with various cloud platforms and services. 
Providers define resources, manage API interactions, and handle resource
 lifecycle management. Each provider corresponds to a specific cloud provider
 or service (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud), allowing users to define
 and manage infrastructure in a consistent, version-controlled manner. 
Providers abstract the complexities of API calls, enabling users to declare 
their desired infrastructure
 state and letting Terraform handle the provisioning, updating, and tearing down of resources.
1. we have a new configuration directory located at the path
/root/terraform-projects/things-to-do.Inspect this directory and find out the number
of providers initialized within this directory. Do not run terraform init yet!
Ans=0

2. How about you? How many provider plugins are installed in this configuration directory?
Ans=1

3. how many configuration files exist in the directory 
/root/terraform-projects/things-to-do?
Ans=1

4. how many resources are configured in this configuration directory?
Ans=2

5. what is the version of the plugin for the local provider that has been downloaded for this 
configuration?
Ans=2.4.0

6. now go ahead and create these resources using terraform! once done, the two files defined
inside the resource blocks should be created with the correct file names and content.
Ans
cd /root/terraform-projects
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

7. we have created another directory containing configuration files at 
/root/terraform-projects/christmas-wishlist.

8. how many resources are configured within this configuration directory?
Ans=2

9. what is the filename that will be created by the resource called cyberpunk?
Ans= "/root/cyberpunk2077.txt"

10. create a new configuration file within the same directory called xbox.tf. this file should
make use of the same local-file resource type with the below requirements:
Resource Name: xbox
filename: /root/xbox.txt
content:Wouldn't mind an XBox either!
solution
touch xbox.tf, fill in the specification, then,
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply

11. now, navigate to the directory /root/terraform-projects/provider-b. we have downloaded a plugin
in this directory. identify the name and type of provider.
if the configuration files in this directory seem unfamiliar, do not worry, these are covered later 
in the course. 
Ans= community-ansible
