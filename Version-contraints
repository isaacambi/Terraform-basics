n Terraform, version constraints are used to specify which versions of a 
provider or module your configuration is compatible with. These constraints
 help ensure that your infrastructure code remains stable and predictable,
 even as new versions of providers or modules are released. Version constraints
 are crucial for maintaining consistent behavior and avoiding unexpected changes.

Version constraints are typically defined using version numbers and operators
 in your Terraform configuration. Here are the common version constraint operators:

    Equal Constraint (=): Specifies an exact version. For example, = 1.2.3 would
 require exactly version 1.2.3.

    Greater Than Constraint (>): Requires a version greater than the specified version.
 For example, > 2.0 would allow any version higher than 2.0.

    Less Than Constraint (<): Requires a version less than the specified version. 
For example, < 1.5 would allow any version lower than 1.5.

    Greater Than or Equal Constraint (>=): Requires a version greater than or equal
 to the specified version. For example, >= 1.0 would allow any version 1.0 or higher.

    Less Than or Equal Constraint (<=): Requires a version less than or equal to the
 specified version. For example, <= 3.0 would allow any version 3.0 or lower.

    Compatible Constraint (~>): Specifies a range of compatible versions. 
For example, ~> 1.2 would allow versions 1.2 and any version that is higher but with
 the same major version (like 1.3, 1.4, etc., but not 2.0).

In your Terraform configuration, you might use version constraints when specifying
 providers or modules. For example:

provider "aws" {
  version = "~> 2.0"
}

module "example_module" {
  source  = "terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws"
  version = "2.0.0"
}

In this example, the provider version constraint ~> 2.0 means that 
any version 2.0.x is allowed, but not versions 2.1 or higher. 
The module version constraint 2.0.0 specifies an exact version.

Version constraints help you manage dependencies and ensure that your
 infrastructure code remains functional and consistent over time, even 
as external components change.
