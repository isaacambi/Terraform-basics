 new configuration directory has been created at /root/terraform-projects/project-shade. 
Inspect it. How many files will be created by this configuration?
Ans= one

2.Now add a count argument to create 3 instances of this resource.

When ready, run terraform init, plan and apply

The main.tf file should be updated as provided below:

resource "local_sensitive_file" "name" {
    filename = "/root/user-data"
    content = "password: S3cr3tP@ssw0rd"
    count = 3 
}

3.The resource local_sensitive_file.name is now created as:
Ans=list

4. What is the id for the resource element at index 1?
Run terraform show or terraform state show local_sensitive_file.name[1]

5.How many files were actually created when apply was run?
Ans=one

6. We have now created a variables.tf file in the same configuration directory. 
Update the main.tf file to make use of the list type variable defined for the
 filename argument.


Use count to loop through all the elements of this list and do not use hard-coded values.

Use the variable called content for the argument called content.
resource "local_sensitive_file" "name" {
    filename = var.users[count.index]
    content = var.content
    count = length(var.users)

}

7. We have reverted back to the old configuration file and cleaned up the resources
 created so far.
A variable called users now has default values added to it.

What type of variable is it?
Ans=list(string)

8. The same elements cannot be used for a set

9.Let's do the same exercise as before but this time we will make use of
 the for_each meta argument to create the files in this configuration.


Just like before don't use any hard-coded values.

Use for_each to loop through the list type variable called users.

Use the variable called content as the value of the argument content within main.tf.

When ready, run terraform init, plan and apply.

10. the resource called name is now created as a map

11. The resource address with the filename - /root/user11 is now represented as:
Check terraform state list
local_sensitive_file.name["/root/user11"]

12.
